Automatic clustering using Modularity-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm
This work applies the community modularity of complex networks to introduce a novel multi-objective evolutionary clustering. 
The proposed algorithm takes the benefits of nodes similarity in a complex network and provides a new structural-based modularity 
to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters. Moreover, the new modularity is then used to design a new recombination and mutation operator so that it generates offspring solutions 
with more diversity.
